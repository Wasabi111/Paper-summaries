#Point Clouds Segmentation Method
This describes two methods used in Point Clouds Segmentation works. PointNet was published on CVPR 2017 by Qi etal of Stanford University: PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation. Here is the link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf. Soon enough, a optimized version PointNet++ was published on NIPS 2017 by them again. The link is: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02413.pdf. This essay(introduction whatever) summeries some key points mentioned in these two papers.
